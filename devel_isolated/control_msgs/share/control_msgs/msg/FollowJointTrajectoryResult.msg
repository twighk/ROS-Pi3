# Human readable description of the error code. Contains complementary
# information that is especially useful when execution fails, for instance:
# - INVALID_GOAL: The reason for the invalid goal (e.g., the requested
#   trajectory is in the past).
# - INVALID_JOINTS: The mismatch between the expected controller joints
#   and those provided in the goal.
# - PATH_TOLERANCE_VIOLATED and GOAL_TOLERANCE_VIOLATED: Which joint
#   violated which tolerance, and by how much.
