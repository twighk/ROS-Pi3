           <li>Node: /move_group</li>
           <li>Parameter: [/robot_description, /robot_description_semantic]</li>
           <li>Topic: Following types are monitored. Published &quot;names&quot; are ignored.<br/>
               [sensor_msgs/PointCloud, sensor_msgs/PointCloud2,
                sensor_msgs/Image, sensor_msgs/CameraInfo]</li>
           </ul>

           assistance from the them), please post issue reports to the designated
           tracker (not MoveIt!'s main tracker).
