Description: The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to
            integrate it tightly with ROS.  For example, SMACH-ROS can call
            ROS services, listen to ROS topics, and integrate
            with <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/actionlib">actionlib</a>
            both as a client, and a provider of action servers.  SMACH is a
            new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to
            quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular
            code.
