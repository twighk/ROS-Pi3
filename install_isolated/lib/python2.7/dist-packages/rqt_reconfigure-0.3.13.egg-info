Description: This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI
        		(reconfigure_gui), and provides the way to view and edit the parameters
        		that are accessible via dynamic_reconfigure.<br/>
        		<br/>
        		(12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary parameters that are not associated 
        		with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure) might 
        		become handled.
        		However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent 
        		on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params latched 
        		to nodes.
Platform: UNKNOWN
