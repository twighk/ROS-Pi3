Description: SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot
            behavior. At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build
            hierarchical state machines. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of
            very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with
            maintainable and modular code.
