Description: rqt_graph provides a GUI plugin for visualizing the ROS
              computation graph.<br/> 
              
              Its components are made generic so that other packages
              where you want to achieve graph representation can depend upon this pkg
              (use <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/rqt_dep">rqt_dep</a> to find out
              the pkgs that depend. rqt_dep itself depends on rqt_graph too).
