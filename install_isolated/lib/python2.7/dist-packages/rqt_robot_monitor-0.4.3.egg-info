Description: rqt_robot_monitor displays diagnostics_agg topics messages that
           are published by <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/diagnostic_aggregator">diagnostic_aggregator</a>.
           rqt_robot_monitor is a direct port to rqt of
           <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_monitor">robot_monitor</a>. All
           diagnostics are fall into one of three tree panes depending on the status of
           diagnostics (normal, warning, error/stale). Status are shown in trees to 
           represent their hierarchy. Worse status dominates the higher level status.<br/>
           <ul>
            Ex. 'Computer' category has 3 sub devices. 2 are green but 1 is error. Then
                'Computer' becomes error.
           </ul>
          You can look at the detail of each status by double-clicking the tree nodes.<br/>
